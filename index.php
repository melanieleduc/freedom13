          <h1>MY STORY</h1>
          <h2>I USED TO BE OVERWEIGHT, unhealthy AND UNHAPPY</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>For many years I struggled. I tried so many different programs and diets to curb my unhealthy lifestyle, but found that nothing worked nearly as well as wearing baggy clothing and hiding from the world.</p>

          <p>Tell me if these sound familiar:</p>

          <ul class="list-inline">
            <li>
              <h3>Physically</h3>
              <p>Health problems, lack of strength and stamina, low libido and sex drive.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Emotionally</h3>
              <p>Poor self-confidence / self-esteem, difficulty managing depression, anxiety, stress, and trouble bouncing back from adversity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Spiritually</h3>
              <p>Little meaning and purposein life, challenges in buildingand maintaining personalrelationships, and lack ofcontentment.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>What started as an oversight of youth became a massive issue in my adult life. My poor health weighed me down, wore me thin, and prevented me from being my best self. When I took a critical look at my life, I knew I needed a change, but nothing worked.</p>

          <p>Eventually, I had to take a hard look at my failures, and create something new that I knew would work. What I created didn’t just treat the symptoms that were plaguing me, but fundamentally changed the habits, lifestyle, and mindset that I had been using to limit myself for far too long.</p>

          <p>After years of perfecting my system, I, Kristopher Simpson, am now considered a Body Transformation expert and a veteran of the Fitness, Nutrition & Weight-Loss industry. In an endless pursuit to help other people achieve the freedom I have, I am also an Author, Speaker, Coach, and Owner of Bodies By Design Personal Training Studios.</p>
